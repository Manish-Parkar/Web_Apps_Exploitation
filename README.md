# Web_Apps_Exploitation

This is my first web exploitation project on Capture The Flag (CTF) which I have completed during my 7 Day long Practical Web Apps Hacking Bootcamp from ShapeAI. In this project, I have created a Vulnerability Assessment Penetration Testing (VAPT) report on picoCTF capture the flag vulnerability which I have found on some dummy websites.
